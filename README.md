# tiny-web-servers

This repository contains implementations of tiny web servers written in C, Java, JavaScript (on Node.js) and Ruby.   All implementations have the same functionality.   

I wrote these to be used for an introduction of network server programming in one of my lectures.

Note that all comments in the source code are in Japanese.
