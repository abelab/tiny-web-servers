# tiny-web-servers

This repository contains implementations of tiny web servers written in C, C#, Elixir, Go, Java, JavaScript (on Node.js), Python, and Ruby.   All implementations have the same functionality.

I wrote these to use as a material of network programming exercises in one of my lectures.

Note that comments in the source code are in Japanese.
